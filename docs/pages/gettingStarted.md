# Lets jump on it!!!


## Installation

first, we will need to install **tree-garden**

`npm i tree-garden` 

should do the trick - as long as you are not using **yarn** :laughing:

tree-garden has **no** dependencies an **no** peer-dependencies, which should help with maintenance, security
and bundle size - feel free to check on [bundlephobia &#x1F609;](https://bundlephobia.com/package/tree-garden@latest)
